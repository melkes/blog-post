## Like most people, I believe pizza is the best food.

At some point I went on a deep dive to find out how to make the best possible pizza at home. I focussed on dough. Ultimately, I found [this old](http://www.varasanos.com/PizzaRecipe.htm) post on a pizza obsessed man's website. It is excellent! They key is to measure the ingredients by weight, and some other things related to technique. 

Despite popular lore, it is __not__ about the water:

>I've heard it said that NY has the best pizza because of the water. This is a myth. Get over it. It's not the water. The water is one of a hundred factors. I filter my whole house with a huge 5 stage system, so I use that. If I didn't have that I'd spring for a $1 bottle of Dasani. That will do it too.

I will expand on these pizza thoughts in further blog posts.
